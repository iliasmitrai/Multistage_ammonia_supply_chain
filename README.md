# Multistage_ammonia_supply_chain
Code for reproducing the results in the paper: A multistage stochastic programming approach for renewable ammonia supply chain network design

To generate the results from the paper, run the multistage_run.py paper as follows:

python3 multistage_run.py 500 economical

The first input is the starting ammonia price and the second input is the scenario (economic vs. renewable transition).
